Generators
==========

Generators are subclasses of

.. autoclass:: boxes.Boxes

Most code is directly in this class. Subclass are supposed to over
write the ``.__init__()`` and ``.render()`` method.

The Boxes class keeps a canvas object (self.ctx) that all
drawing is made on. In addition it keeps a couple of global settings
used for various drawing operations. See the ``.__init__()`` method
for the details. 

For implementing a new generator forking an existing one or using the
``boxes/generators/_template.py`` is probably easier than starting
from scratch.

Many methods and attributes are for use of the subclasses. These
methods are the interface for the user interfaces to interact with the
generators:

.. automethod:: boxes.Boxes.__init__
		
.. automethod:: boxes.Boxes.parseArgs
.. automethod:: boxes.Boxes.render

.. automethod:: boxes.Boxes.open
.. automethod:: boxes.Boxes.close

Handling Generators
-------------------
		
To handle the generators there is code in the ``boxes.generators``
package.

.. automodule:: boxes.generators
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

This adds generators to the user interfaces automatically. For this to
work it is important that the class names are unique. So whenever you
start a new generator please change the class name right away.
