A manual page <package>.<section> will be generated. You may view the
manual page with: nroff -man <package>.<section> | less'. A typical entry
in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

DB2MAN = /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/docbook-xsl/manpages/docbook.xsl
XP     = xsltproc -''-nonet -''-param man.charmap.use.subset "0"

manpage.1: manpage.xml
        $(XP) $(DB2MAN) $<

The xsltproc binary is found in the xsltproc package. The XSL files are in
docbook-xsl. A description of the parameters you can use can be found in the
docbook-xsl-doc-* packages. Please remember that if you create the nroff
version in one of the debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need
to include xsltproc and docbook-xsl in your Build-Depends control field.
Alternatively use the xmlto command/package. That will also automatically
pull in xsltproc and docbook-xsl.

Notes for using docbook2x: docbook2x-man does not automatically create the
AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections. In this case, please add them manually as
<refsect1> ... </refsect1>.

To disable the automatic creation of the AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections
read /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/doc/manpages/authors.html. This file can be
found in the docbook-xsl-doc-html package.

Validation can be done using: `xmllint -''-noout -''-valid manpage.xml`

    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> is a program that generates
      SVG images that can be viewed directly in a web brower but also
      postscript and - with pstoedit as external helper -
      other vector formats including dxf, plt (aka hpgl) and gcode.
    </para>
    <para>
      Of course the library and the generators allow selecting the
      "thickness" of the material used and automatically adjusts lengths and
      width of joining fingers and other elements.
    </para>
    <para>
      The "burn" parameter compensates for the material removed by the
      laser. This allows fine tuning the gaps between joins up to the point
      where plywood can be press fitted even without any glue.
    </para>
    <para>
      inger Joints are the work horse of the library. They allow 90Â°
      edges and T connections. Their size is scaled up with the material
      "thickness" to maintain the same appearance. The library also allows
      putting holes and slots for screws (bed bolts) into finger joints,
      although this is currently not supported for the included generators.
    </para>
    <para>
      Dovetail joints can be used to join pieces in the same plane.
    </para>
    <para>
      Flex cuts allows bending and stretching the material in one
      direction. This is used for rounded edges and living hinges.
