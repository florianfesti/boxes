class BurnTest(Boxes):
    """Test different burn values"""
    description = """This generator will make shapes that you can use to select
optimal value for burn parameter for other generators. After burning try to
attach sides with the same value and use best fitting one on real projects.
In this generator set burn in the Default Settings to the lowest value
to be tested. To get an idea cut a rectangle with known nominal size and
measure the shrinkage due to the width of the laser cut. Now you can
measure the burn value that you should use in other generators. It is half
the difference of the overall size as shrinkage is occurring on both
sides. You can use the reference rectangle as it is rendered without burn
correction.

See also LBeam that can serve as compact BurnTest and FlexTest for testing flex settings.
